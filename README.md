# PTSD Continuous Monitoring Systems
### Predictive modeling for PTSD episodes in users

Veteran participants are asked to wear a monitor to collect constant biometric data as the system allows. Focusing on heart-rate values, the data is cleaned and prepared for machine-learning modeling to allow for predictive actions to be taken place. Any information may be transparently shared with healthcare providers as stipulated.

Full documentation will be provided on project completion (11/18/2019)
